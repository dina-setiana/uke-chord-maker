{comment:Intro/Overview}
UkeGeeks "knows" only basic chords (hey, it has more than
160, which is a bunch more than I know), so how do you 
teach it new chords? 

Easy! Use [Gm7b5]the "define" tag

{comment: Same Chord, Different Voicings}
Sometimes [C]you want to show
[C-2pos]Second postion chord diagrams...
And other times [C-alt]recommend an alternate fingering

{c:...And Did You Know}
You can [Ice]name your [Cream]chords [Pie]anything!

{c:Optional}
[G-alt]You don't have to include the "extra" fingers,
Such as barre chords...
(but it helps)
